## Pascal Components

 This kit includes the following components:

* `TCatHighlighters` - Provides quick access to multiple SynEdit highlighters with a color scheme adapted from the CodeRay project.
* `THTMLEntities` - HTML Entity Encoder and Decoder.
* `TCatHTMLParser` - HTML Parser based on a component by Przemyslaw Jankowski.
* `TCatJSON` - JSON Manipulation component built on top of the XSuperObject or SuperObject.
* `TCatListEditor` - A list editor based on SuperList by David Koretzky.
* `TCatMsg`, `TCatMsgCromis` - Easy to deploy IPC components.
* `TStringPattern`, `TIntegerPattern` - Flexible pattern validation engine using method chaining.
* `TCatPreferences` - JSON-Based settings management component
* `TCatStorage` - VFS/Cache component that uses the Structured Storage library by Primoz Gabrijelcic.
* `TCatSynEdit` - Enhanced SynEdit with popup menu and improved scrolling.
* `TJIniList` - INI-Like component using JSON
* `TStringListCache` - Caches multiple string lists, allowing them to be loaded or saved together to a file.
* `TStringLoop`, `TSepStringLoop` - Simple components for looping through a string list or a separated string.
* Several libraries with string manipulation functions, file system functions and more.

## Compatibility

All components here work with the latest Delphi releases (for both 32-bit and 64-bit compilation) and the older D7. Most of them may work with FPC and Lazarus.

Most components can be cross-compiled with Delphi XE10 Tokyo and CrossVCL.

### Before Compiling

CatPrefs: Rename the `src\CatCryptKey.pas` file, edit it and add your own encryption keys or key generators.
